This effect can trigger once every 5s. When the equipper consumes 25 or more Energy, the DMG dealt by all squad members increases by 10%/11.5%/13%/14.5%/16%, stacking up to 2 times, and lasting 20s. Repeated triggers reset the duration. Only one instance of this effect can exist in the same squad.",
