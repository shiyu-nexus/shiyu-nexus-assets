Even though this W-Engine looks like a cruel confinement chamber, Rina's Bangboo seem to enjoy sneaking in there to recharge their batteries. They even treat resting inside as a cozy reward. \"Shhh... The two little ones are resting; if they're woken suddenly they'll be sure to cause a ruckus. Let's avoid making any noise while we enjoy our tea.\" â€” Rina, giving a gentle reminder as she serves tea to friends",
