She's the core talent in developing and patenting Belobog's in-Hollow machinery.\nShe's obsessed with gears, metal and wires â€” a true mechanical geek. She's eager to dismantle and study any machinery or equipment she takes an interest in: \"Such sharp and strong lines, truly beautiful... I can't help but want to open it up and take a look.\"\n\nGrace always shows extraordinary patience when dealing with machines, doting on the sophisticated metal constructions as if they were her own children.\nAccording to the information at hand, Grace is probably the only one who can playfully refer to Koleda as \"Sweet Pea\" without receiving a kick in the shin.\nQuestion: Based on Grace's understanding of machines, would she consider me one? I'm currently lacking a physical form, however, so I don't possess components like gears, metal, or wires.",
