Refers to herself as \"Nekomata.\"\nA cat Thiren with feline traits, possessing great dexterity when hunting and an insatiable curiosity about the outside world.\nSometimes mischievous, she engages in harmless pranks. But when she sets her sights on a target, her feline-like agility and focus are enough to leave others in awe.\nShe's most interested in other people's wallets.\nRecommendation: Always keep an eye on your wallet when Nekomata is around.\n\nIn the past, Nekomata was a member of the long-standing Red Fang Gang. Its leader, Miguel Silver, took on a fatherly role in her life. Nonetheless, due to differing beliefs from the gang, she opted to part ways and go it alone.\nFollowing certain encounters involving Nicole and others, she eventually opted to enlist in Gentle House, thus becoming the third member of the team.",
