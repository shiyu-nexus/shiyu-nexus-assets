She grew up very privileged, with anything she could ever want within grasp... except for freedom.\nAfter her Ether Aptitude test results came back high, Lucy decided she wanted to be a Hollow Investigator, but her family disapproved. She was met with harsh words, isolation and confinement, and emotional abuse which led to her deciding to leave to find her own freedom.\n\"Hmph! There's no chance I'll ever go back! If I'm found... then I can say goodbye to the stars and sky and I'll have to inherit the family business instead!\"\nLucy is extremely competitive. She loves to win and hates losing.\n\nCurrently, the one who has given her the most bitter taste of defeat is Caesar, so Lucy keeps challenging Caesar to duels, losing then challenging again, challenging then losing again.",
