In the Outer Ring, the Champion of a team refers to the one responsible for dealing with the opponent's strongest fighter in a gang fight, and they often need to participate in one-on-one duels. Their victory is crucial, as it brings glory and morale to the entire team. \"The Champion can perish, but cannot lose.\" A red scarf is what identifies the Champion of the Sons of Calydon. Even if the opponent doesn't know Lighter, they'll know who he is just from seeing that red scarf. From what is currently known, Lighter is actually very low profile. He only steals the spotlight on the battlefield when he acts on his obligations as Champion. Note: Lighter is the second Red Scarf of the Sons of Calydon. He teasingly refers to the previous Red Scarf as \"Brother\" or \"predecessor.\"",
