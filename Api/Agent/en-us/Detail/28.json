Even if you see Miyabi in the office, it's unlikely she's dealing with paperwork, and more likely polishing her sword. Being conferred the title of Void Hunter due to her outstanding contributions, she's an elite amongst elites in Section 6. She has great prestige amongst the citizens. Once, Miyabi accidentally wandered into a \"Miyabi Fan Club\" hosted offline event. Miyabi was thought to be a fan with godlike impersonation skills, and that event resulted in a precious visual recording. Hoshimi Miyabi is honest and pragmatic. She is not simply a martial artist obsessed with her art and without care for the world around her. Anyone who knows her will realize she's always pursued justice in her heart... even if it may eventually cause a revolution.\n\nHoshimi Miyabi is the heir to a famed martial arts family in New Eridu. According to an insider, Miyabi's mother died when she was young and Miyabi's relationship with her father is rather odd. Note: Miyabi's father has not taken any civil or administrative positions within New Eridu.\n\n\"Phew, luckily I got a good boss.\n\nThis job might be worthwhile after all.\"\n\n— Asaba Harumasa\n\nAt first, the way she speaks might be difficult to understand,\n\nbut it's not as bad as the rumors suggest...\n\nIn any case, you'll understand once you meet her.\"\n\n— Zhu Yuan\n\n\"What day are we on the boss's 'determining\n\nmelon content by eating melon products' training program?\"\n\n— Soukaku,\n\nwho claims to have already forgotten what melon tastes like\n\n\"Thank you so much, Commander.\n\nBehind you... is that, uh... an eye Thiren?\"\n\n— A survivor\n\nrescued from the Hollows by Miyabi",
