Caesar actively listens to and implements any valid suggestion she hears â€” regardless of who it comes from.\nShe is completely defenseless against those she trusts. Once she accepts someone, she considers them part of her inner circle, treating them with absolute trust.\n(Assumption: Caesar currently views you in this way.)\n\nCaesar's father has been missing for as long as she can remember, and her mother passed away from illness when she was young. She was raised by Big Daddy, who took a very hands-off approach to raising her, allowing her to grow up freely and independently.\n\nIn addition, Caesar seems to have a curious interest in matters related to romance.\n\nIf you wish to get closer to her, you might want to try discussing this topic with her.",
