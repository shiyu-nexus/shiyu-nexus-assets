Known for her calm, decisive decision-making and professional, efficient style, she's an irreplaceable pillar behind Astra. \"In terms of commercial value, if Astra Yao represents the 1, then Evelyn is all the 0s that follow,\" a reporter from an entertainment magazine stated.\n\nEvelyn is skilled at planning comprehensive schedules and product endorsements, while also ensuring Astra Yao's safety during any unexpected situations. \"Want to get close to Astra Yao? You'll have to get past Evelyn Chevalier first...\" Though she's always busy with work, Evelyn never seems overwhelmed, and she has an almost obsessive attention to detail, ensuring that every performance and every product endorsement goes through her strict scrutiny. But strangely, such an exceptional manager is not trusted by her parent company, Odeum HAE.\n\nIntel: Evelyn's role seems to go beyond just being a manager and personal bodyguard; there seems to be an \"organization\" behind her.\n\nIt seems a lot of people in Astra Yao's central Astranauts group ship them together.",
