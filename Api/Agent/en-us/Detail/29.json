For now, it seems she can still use an excuse like, \"The store offers rare versions of old movies, and I've got such good taste in movies, so of course I'd love it!\" But being the biggest celebrity in Ridu, such frequent visits to a video rental store are not exactly conducive to keeping our identity under wraps. But, who cares about that! If our identity gets exposed, so be it — Astra can't not come. Contemplation: Creating various situations to bring Astra and Master together is a great way to win the Master's favor.",
