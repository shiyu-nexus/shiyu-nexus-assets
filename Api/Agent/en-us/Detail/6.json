I don't know what she's doing with it all though, seems like she's doing nothing.\"\n— The above is a quote from a popular post on Inter-Knot: \"Her odd-job agency is outrageous. I've never encountered a boss who knows how to turn everything into profit!\"\nThe individual involved responded, \"This, this is a false accusation! I, Nicole, have never been skilled at making money — mainly because I don't have any money to begin with!\"\nAccording to reliable sources, the Cunning Hares are constantly in debt, and their \"careful budgeting\" seems to have no effect on the organization.",
