There have been times when he practiced the subjects he wasn't good at until he cried.\nSeth is quite smart, but his personality often leads to him being taken advantage of by cunning criminals, or sometimes, coworkers (?).\nThe subject he's worst at is infiltration. Rumor has it that he holds the academy record for \"fastest to get busted\" in infiltration tasks. Based on the video intel we have, he seems a bit slow to catch on. For instance, when someone is being sarcastic, it takes him a long time to realize it.",
