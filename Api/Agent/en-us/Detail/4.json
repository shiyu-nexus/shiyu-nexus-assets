Before registering as an employee of Gentle House, all data relating to Anby is suspiciously blank.\nDespite her extreme lack of common sense, Anby is well-versed in matters related to combat and is among the strongest combatants of the Cunning Hares.\n\nAnby's greatest interest is movies, of which she likes an extensive range of genres. Due to an excessive obsession, she tends to take the stories in movies as reality.\nContrary to her seemingly emotionless appearance, Anby is easily moved by movie storylines.\nHer favorite food is hamburgers because \"they contain protein, carbs, and greens, taste good, and are even affordable â€” there's nothing else besides hamburgers.",
