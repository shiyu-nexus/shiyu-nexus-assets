Apart from taking care of Soukaku's day-to-day affairs, she is also responsible for and takes responsibility for all of Soukaku's behavior at work.\n\nSection 6 Chief Hoshimi Miyabi possesses a rather eccentric personality; Asaba Harumasa, a member of Section 6, is overly relaxed and carefree; and Soukaku, another member of Section, 6 is still an innocent and excitable child, so most of the team's work falls upon Yanagi's shoulders.\nSerious, diligent, and meticulous, Tsukishiro Yanagi is the only \"normal\" person on the team, so to speak. It is only due to her guidance and leadership that the strength of the three who make up Section 6's primary on-field force can be transformed into true combat power.\nOverall, Tsukishiro Yanagi is a talented and highly efficient executive officer, whose abilities are both exceptional and comprehensive.\nHowever, from certain data, Tsukishiro Yanagi appears to have a somewhat clumsy side to her when it comes to day-to-day affairs.",
